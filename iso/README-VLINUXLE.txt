Thank you for choosing VLinux LE!
If you're reading this from the OS, you're already in.
to install it to the harddrive, format it with another Linux live CD (this doesn't have gui formatting tools, yet)
over the slax directory and go into boot and run bootinst.sh

you can delete this if you want :)

If you can't tell, VLinux LE is based on Slax, check that out too, it's cool.
