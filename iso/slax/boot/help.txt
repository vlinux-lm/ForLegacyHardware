 Welcome to VLinux LE (it's based on slax, check that out too).

 Select a pre-configured option from the boot menu, or press [Tab] key to
 manually edit the boot command line in order to customize how Slax boots.
 A detailed description of various boot parameters is provided below.

 * toram: If specified, all data are copied to memory during startup so you
   can eject the boot device. Needs enough RAM to store all necessary files.

 * nosound: If specified, sound devices are muted during startup

 * perchdir=[resume|new|ask|device]: All changes you make to Slax can be
   saved to a writable media. By default, the directory /slax/changes is
   used for this purpose if you run Slax from flash drive or disk. To save
   Slax changes to a different disk, or when running Slax from CD, use
   perchdir=/dev/writable_device/path

 * perchsize=[size_MB]: When stored on non-linux filesystem such as FAT32,
   sessions are limited to maximum size of 16GB. You can increase the limit
   with this parameter, use just once. For example perchsize=32GB

 * from=[file|path|device|ask] is used to set a directory or even device
   from which is Slax started. For example, from=/slax, from=/dev/sr1/data
   or from=http://some_url/to_iso_file.iso, or from=ask to select from list

 * noload=[regex] is used to specify what modules will not be loaded. Use
   a regular expression, for example noload=04-apps or noload=apps|chromium
